# Elementor Test

### Getting it work
Just to run it under php server.
there are 2 main files: 
- `index.php` which serve the `index.html` file
- `data.php` which returns json response with "lorem ipsum" data

### Side note
I think that I didn't`t really understand the requirements for the php part, let me know if I did something wrong.
