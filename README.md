# Elementor Test

### Getting it work
1. cd into the repo directory
2. run php built in server: `php -S localhost:8000`
3. open `localhost:8000` in your favorite browser

:exclamation:**Important note**:exclamation: - I am using ES Modules on this project without any bundler, so the code will work only in modern browser. (in production apps I will use some bundler or JS compiler).

### Side note
I think that I didn't`t really understand the requirements for the php part, let me know if I did something wrong.

**You are more than welcome to ask me anything else you want to know**
